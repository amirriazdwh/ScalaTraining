// A common definition of function between two sets (or between two classes, when working in GBN) is based on the notion of
// "ordered pair". An ordered pair is some set-theoretic construction, denoted "(a,b)" where a and b are sets, with the property
// that (a,b)=(c,d) if and only if a=c and b=d. There are many ways of achieving this; the most common is the Kuratowski
// definition of ordered pair:
